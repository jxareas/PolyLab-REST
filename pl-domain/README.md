`pl-domain` - Domain-Oriented Microservices for PolyLab

## Overview

The `pl-domain` module is a collection of domain-oriented microservices for the PolyLab system. It follows tactical Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns and utilizes noun-driven development principles to provide focused functionality for specific domains within the API.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that emphasizes a deep understanding of the business domain and uses that understanding to guide the design and implementation of software systems. DDD encourages building software that closely aligns with the language, concepts, and business processes of the domain. This approach helps in creating maintainable, scalable, and flexible systems that better reflect real-world business needs.

### Noun-Driven Development

Noun-Driven Development is a principle that emphasizes organizing code and architecture around domain nouns (entities, value objects, aggregates) rather than focusing solely on technical concerns. This approach helps in creating a clear and expressive model of the domain, making the codebase more readable, maintainable, and aligned with the business requirements.

## Microservices Architecture

The `pl-domain` module follows a microservices architecture, where functionality is divided into small, independently deployable services. Each microservice focuses on a specific domain within PolyLab, enabling scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance. Microservices communicate with each other through RESTful APIs, allowing for loose coupling and independent evolution of services.

## Technology Stack

The `pl-domain` module utilizes the following technologies:

- Spring Boot: The microservices are developed using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and efficient foundation for building Java applications.

- Microservices Architecture: The module follows a microservices architecture pattern, allowing for the independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual services.

**Note**: *The microservices register with Eureka Server for service discovery, enabling dynamic routing and load balancing.*

## Getting Started

To get started with this module, follow these steps:
1. Boot the Eureka Discovery Server and ensure that the microservices are registered and discoverable.
2. Build and run the individual microservices according to their specific README files.
3. Refer to the documentation of each microservice for detailed information on their functionality, APIs, and usage.
